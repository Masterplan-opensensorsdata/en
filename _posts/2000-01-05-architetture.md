The architectures are the fundamental structures of the building site. The overall architecture is composed of different levels, one on top of the other; each level instantiates roles and activities and requires appropriate safety measures. According to a Top-Down progression we have:

0. LEVEL 0

	* **Description**: it is the level zero, where the evaluation of the project takes place. Executive and designers discuss the building site with the site engineer.

	* **Activities**: 

		1. Discuss the requests.
		2. Define the priorities.
		3. Stipulate the MVP.
		4. Set an appropriate time-frame.

1. LEVEL 1

	* **Activities**:

		1. Individuate the requirements.
		2. Compose the backlog.
		3. Select the site managers.
		4. Assign the necessary resources
		5. Define the time-frames.

2. LEVEL 2

		3. Determine the expertise.

5. LEVEL 5 

	* **Roles**: Team Leader - DataHat squad

	* **Description**: is the ground level, where the team leaders select and monitor its datahat squad.

	* **Activities**:

		1. Access to datahat. 
		2. Use of datahat.
