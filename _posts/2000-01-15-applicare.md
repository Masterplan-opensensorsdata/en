The result of every verification phase is an input for further sprints. Application and planning are closely connected in that the output of the former is taken to be the input of the latter. Like the PDCA, the sprint works in cycle; it works by exploiting errors and improve the effectiveness of the workflow. 

This section is of general interest and pertains to every level of the architecture.

#### <i class="fa fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Prescriptions 

1. The solution to a problem should be satisfactory for each role affected by the problem.
2. Implemented upgrades should always be documented so that can be reused to improve the responsiveness of all workers in the building site. The documentation should be seen as an handbook for further possible upgrades.
3. The site managers should not impose an upgrade; they should always negotiate any change in schedule with team leaders.
4. Errors are parts of the building process. They shouldnâ€™t be chancy; rather, they should be a matter of conscious organizational management.
5. Failure to document an issue, or a problem, might results in a more serious failure of the building site and, as a consequence, of the project.

#### <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> Preventions

1. Is the documentation relative to an upgrade that request specific expertise to be solved?
2. Can site engineers reuse one upgrade to improve the work of other team leaders?
3. Can site managers evaluate how much team leaders are satisfied with their workload?
