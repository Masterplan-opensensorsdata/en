Each site manager should be aware that more team leaders work in the building site, more time will be spent to curate communication of tasks and users stories. Documentation can assist in the quest, if and only if the documentation is clear, concise and easy to access. The documentation plays a crucial role in the economy of organization. Communication channels can be designed using the standard formula:

<code>communication channels = n(n-1)/2</code>

where n stands for number of people involved.

This section is of particular interest to Team Leaders and Site Managers. It pertains to Level 3 (Site Managers-Team Leaders).

2. Experts should be coordinated on the basis of their actual contribution to the project, rather than merely on their expertise.
3. The site manager discusses and arranges one priority at a time with each team leader.
4. The documentation must be effective in reducing the number of meetings and their duration.
5. Documentation is needed in order to check and improve the deployment of user stories in sprints’ retrospective. 

#### <i class="fa fa-question-circle"></i> Preventions

2. Did each team leader accomplished her role?
3. Are there tasks that require to be managed by more than one team leader?
4. Are team leaders actively cooperating together?
